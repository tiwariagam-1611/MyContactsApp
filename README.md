MyContactsApp
MyContactsApp is a modular Java console application for managing contacts. It demonstrates object-oriented principles and classic design patterns through twelve use cases (UC‑01 to UC‑12). The application covers registration, authentication, profile management, contact creation and editing, search, filtering, tagging, and bulk operations. Each use case is implemented step by step to show how features evolve in a structured way.

Use Cases
UC‑01: Registration
Users can register as either FREE or PREMIUM. This use case demonstrates object creation using Factory and Builder patterns, with validation and repository persistence.

UC‑02: Login
Users can log in using BasicAuth (email and password) or OAuth (email only). This use case applies the Strategy pattern to allow interchangeable authentication methods.

UC‑03: Profile Management
Logged-in users can update their name, email, or password. This use case uses the Command pattern to encapsulate profile update actions.

UC‑04: Create Contact
Users can create PersonContact or OrganizationContact and assign tags during creation. This use case demonstrates Factory, Builder, and Flyweight patterns, along with inheritance and set operations.

UC‑05: View Contact Details
Contacts can be displayed in either basic or formatted style. This use case applies the Decorator pattern to extend display behavior dynamically.

UC‑06: Edit Contact
Users can edit a contact’s name, phone, or email. The Command and Memento patterns are used to encapsulate edit actions and support undo functionality.

UC‑07: Delete Contact
Users can delete contacts. Observers such as logging modules are notified automatically. This use case demonstrates the Observer pattern for event-driven updates.

UC‑08: Bulk Operations
Users can perform bulk delete, bulk tag, or bulk export operations. The Composite pattern is used to treat groups of contacts and single contacts uniformly.

UC‑09: Search Contacts
Users can search by name, phone, email, or tag. This use case applies a criteria-based approach, similar to the Strategy pattern, to encapsulate search logic.

UC‑10: Advanced Filtering
Users can filter contacts by tag, date added, or frequency, and sort results by name, date, or frequency. This use case demonstrates composite filtering and comparator usage.

UC‑11: Manage Tags
Users can create and list tags. The Flyweight pattern ensures that tags are shared instances, saving memory and enforcing consistency.

UC‑12: Apply Tags to Contacts
Users can assign multiple tags to existing contacts. This use case demonstrates association handling between Contact and Tag, with observer notifications for updates.
